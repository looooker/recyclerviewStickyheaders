If you need sticky headers feature, have a look to [recyclerview-stickyheaders](https://github.com/eowise/recyclerview-stickyheaders)

I don't have enought time to maintain this lib anymore. Retrospectively, I'm not sure that ItemDecoration is the best way to implement sticky headers, especially when dynamic add, remove and reorder of items is needed. If you need sticky headers feature, have a look to [SuperSLiM](https://github.com/TonicArtos/SuperSLiM) or [FlexibleAdapter](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter).
